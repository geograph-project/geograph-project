form_title:
    title: Form Headline
    content: >
        This title text is shown in a gray box above the form fields

form_instructions:
    title: Form Instructions
    content: >
        You can add extra instructions which will help guide the user into
        the context of the form fields and possibly highlight required data.

field_sort:
    title: Field Display Position
    content: >
        Click on the up-and-down arrow icon and drag the field row to sort
        within this form. Sorting preference does not take effect until the
        form is saved.

field_label:
    title: Field Label
    content: >
        This label is shown as the prompt for this field. Typically, a
        short-answer field would be rendered like this one:<br>
        <strong>Label:</strong>&nbsp; <input type="text">

field_type:
    title: Field Content Type
    content: >
        This is used to define the type of input expected from the user. You
        can select from short and long answer, phone number, date and time,
        checkbox, drop-down list, or a custom list selection.
    links:
      - title: Custom Lists
        href: /scp/lists.php

field_internal:
    title: Field Visibility
    content: >
        Fields marked internal are hidden from your clients. Use internal
        fields to track things which only your staff need to access.

field_required:
    title: Data Requirement
    content: >
        Forms that have required fields must have valid data before the form
        can be saved. If checked, forms cannot be submitted or saved until all
        required fields are satisfied.<br>
        <br>
        Internal fields can only be required of staff members, since they
        are hidden from clients.

field_variable:
    title: Field Automation
    content: >
        The field data will be available to email and page templates via the
        name used in this column. For instance, fields on the common ticket
        form are available via <code>%{ticket.variable}</code>, where
        <strong>variable</strong> is the name used in this column.<br>
        <br>
        <em>Company information is available via
        <code>%{</code><code>company.variable}</code> and user information is available
        via <code>%{ticket.user.variable}</code></em>

field_delete:
    title: Remote this Field
    content: >
        Check and save the form to remove a field from this form.<br>
        <br>
        <em>Deleting a field does not remove previously entered data for the
        field on completed forms. For instance, if a previously submitted
        ticket has data for a field, deleting the field from this form will
        not remove the data on the ticket.</em>
