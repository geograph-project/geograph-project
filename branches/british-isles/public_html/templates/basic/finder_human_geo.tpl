	<h2><a href="/finder/">Finder</a> :: Cooperative Searching</h2>

<p>Oh dear, we have already decided to discontinue this feature, and instead do it differently.</p>

<p>We are going to do the same thing with <b>tags</b>. Can read general information <a href="/article/Tags">about tags here</a>.</p>

<p><b>There is now a new prototype "Geographical Features" listing <a href="/tags/geographical_features.php">available here</a>.</b></p> 

<ul>
	<li>To add a new image to the list, simply tag an image with a special tag. Eg to add something into the "Coastal Erosion" list, tag an image with "geographical feature:Coastal Erosion".<br/><br/></li>
	<li>Note: This works with private or public tags, so can tag other peoples images to make them appear in this special list.<br/><br/></li>
	<li>To add another item to the list, just create the relavant tag on an image, the geographical features listing page will automatically update (subject to a few hours delay).<br/><br/></li>
	<li>Known issue: There is no moderation, or reporting facalities (to combat abuse) yet; but tags will need such a system, so there will be one with time. For anything urgent <a href="/usermsg.php?to=3">contact me</a>.<br/><br/></li>
</ul>
