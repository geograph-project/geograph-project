Dear {$realname},

Thank you for registering your interest in {$hectad}, we would now like to invite you to adopt this square. 

Click the following link to continue to the adoption page, 
http://{$http_host}/adopt/?accept={$hectad}

If this has been offered to someone already, they may adopt the square in the meantime. However, if you are the first to receive an invitation for {$hectad}, then you have 7 days from this email in which to accept. If after 7 days you have not accepted, it may be offered to someone else. 

Upon accepting this invitation you informally agree to: 

 * Create and maintain a representative mosaic, this includes:
   * Choose a representative photo for each square in the hectad
   * Act as final arbitrator in cases where others wish to suggest alternatives 
   * Check back on the square from time to time to check if new alternatives are available
 
 * Check the land/sea percentage for the squares
   * A tool for this purpose will be made available

 * Formally mark appropriate squares as 'impossible' 
   * if/when we introduce such a facility
 
 * Have your name, and link to your profile, listed on the mosaic page, as a contact for dealing with queries. 
 
The latest version of this list will be available at:

Regards, 

Geograph Team
