<h2>Geograph Map Clusters</h2>


<p>The GeoCubes API, that powered this map, has been offline since 2011, so this feature is no longer available.</p>




<p>The <a href="/browser/">Browser</a>, offers a similar mapping function with the "<a href="/browser/#!/display=map_dots">Map - Dots</a>" view.
	We will be devoting our energy to improving that mapping function. Already it offers far superior filtering/searching functionality, and will be adding more mapping layers. </p>


<p>We also have an <a href="/mapper/quick.php?q=canal">experimental mapping interface</a> which offers a basic mapping function with nice animated zooming function</p>
