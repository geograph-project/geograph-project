<h2>Voting information</h2>
 
<div class="interestBox">Voting on Geograph is an <span style="color:red">experimental</span> feature. No promises we will use this data, however we hope that it will be useful in some way.</div>


<p>A few points:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Voting is totally <b>anonymous</b>, and the data will never be used in any identifiable way. This includes letting others know you have voted at all.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>However, voting <b>is</b> recorded against your account, to help eliminate duplicates.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>Only your <b>last</b> vote for a particular item will count.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>Your vote should always be personal, even if that is subjective, rather than what you think the majority would be.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>The aim is not to highlight the lower end of the scale.<br/><br/></li>
 </ul>

<p>And in particular in regard to 1-5 'stars' <img src="http://{$static_host}/img/star-light.png" width="14" height="14" />:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Click a star for the item in question, on a scale of 1 to 5 stars.</li>
    <li>You should approach voting with the aim to <b>promote the good stuff</b>, rather than root out and penalize the lower end of the scale.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>In general we are more likely to take note of 4 and 5 star votes, and take little notice of 1 and 2 star votes.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>The 'average' is 3 - which is effectively the same as no vote at all.<br/><br/></li>
 </ul>

<p>In regard to 'thumbs up' <img src="http://{$static_host}/img/thumbs.png" width="20" height="20" />  icons:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Click these if you particularly like the image or text description, using the separate icons for each.<br/><br/></li>
</ul>
