<h2>Only one result per group?</h2>

<p>The <a href="/help/credits">software</a> that drives our search can only at this time return one image from a particular 'group', such as grid square or month.</p>

<p>This is a very powerful concept as it allows us to get a quick overview of images, without returning lots of similar images.</p>

<p>Hopefully the technology to return multiple (for example the top three) will soon become available.</p>

<ul>
	<li>We also hope to have more control over which image(s) are actually shown from each group or cluster, at the moment it's pretty much chosen at random.</li>
</ul>
