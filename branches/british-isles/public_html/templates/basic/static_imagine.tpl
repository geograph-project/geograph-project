<h2>Through The Square Window..... <sup style="color:red">New!</sup></h2>

<p>We have created a new page specially designed for use in the classroom. 
Here a map is shown, the class can be asked to imagine what the landscape looks like at the spot highlighted, and then a button can be clicked to reveal the photo to see how it matches up.</p>


<h3>Example</h3>

<p>We have created this <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/search.php?i=1796032&displayclass=reveal">quick example</a> for you to use, but you can create your own set of images:</p>


Either

<ul><li>Use the Advanced Search to create a custom search and in the 'Finally' section, select 'I would like to display a ... [slideshow - map imagine]'</li></ul>

or 

<ul><li>on any search results page, select <i>Display Format</i> 'slideshow - map imagine' at the bottom of the page (or top right)</li></ul>


<h3>TIP: Hand picking images</h3>

<p>You can do this using the 'Marked Images' feature. When browsing search results, if you select the "+ links" display format, then you can mark individual images. The button can also be found at the top right on any full size photo page.</p>

<p>Note: images are replayed in the order marked</p>

<p>Once you have some images in your list, return to the <a href="/search.php">main search page</a>, and in the 'Marked Images' section, select 'View as Search Results' - you now have a set of results just showing your images, which you can turn into a 'slideshow - map imagine' as above.</p>

<div class="interestBox">Let us know how you get on!</div>
