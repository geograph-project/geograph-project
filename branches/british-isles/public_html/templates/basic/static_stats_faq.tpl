<h3>How do I get a Geograph point for my image?</h3> 
	<small><i>(copied from the main <a href="/faq.php">FAQ</a> page)</i><br/><br/></small>

	<p>If you're the first to submit a &quot;Geograph&quot; for the grid square
	you'll get a "First Geograph" point added to your profile and the warm glow that comes
	with it.</p> 
 
	<p>We welcome many Geograph images per square, so even if you don't get the point, you are still making a valuable contribution to the project.</p> 
 
	<blockquote> 
 
		<p>In addition we now award "Second Visitor" points (and Third and Fourth!) - which are given to the first Geograph the <i>second contributor</i> adds to a square. The third contributor similarly gets a "Third" point for their first Geograph to the square. </p> 
 
		<p>So a single square can have a First, Second, Third and Fourth Visitor point, but a contributor can only get one of those per square.</p> 
 
		<p>You can earn yourself a "Personal" point by submitting a &quot;Geograph&quot; for a square that is new to you, regardless of how many contributors have been there before.</p>

<h3>How do TPoints work?</h3>

If there isn't a geograph taken within 5 years of a geograph you submit, you get a TPoint.

<h3>Whats a 'Myriad'? A 'hectad'?</h3>

We couldn't find unabigious names for larger units of area, so we made our own! A Hectad is 10km x 10km. Whereas a myriad is 100km x 100km.

		<li><b>Seconds</b>: a "<b>Second Visitor</b>" point is awarded for the second person to contribute a Geograph to a square<br/><br/></li>
		<li><b>Thirds</b>: similarlly a "<b>Third Visitor</b>" point is awarded for the third person to contribute a Geograph to a square<br/><br/></li>
		<li><b>Fourths</b>: and therefore a "<b>Fourth Visitor</b>" point is awarded for the fourth person to contribute a Geograph to a square<br/><br/></li>
		<li><b>AllPoints</b>: Total of First/Second/Third/Fourth Visitor Points<br/><br/></li>
		<li><b>Personal Points</b>: The first Geograph image submitted by each user in a square gets a Personal Point<br/><br/></li>

    		<li><b>Spread</b>: number of hectads divided by number of images<br><small>Higher numbers indicate a large number of hectads, with few images</small><br/><br/></li>
    		<li><b>AntiSpread</b>: number of images images divided by hectads<br><small>Equivalent to depth score at hectad level</small><br/><br/></li>
