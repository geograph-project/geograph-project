    <h2>Ads on Geograph</h2>
 
<p>Before you go, a quick <b>Thank you</b> for supporting ads on Geograph, we are running short on cash, and need to raise funds quickly.</p>

<div class="interestBox"><big><a href="/">Continue on to the advertiser website &gt; &gt;</a></big></div>

<p>or read on for more information...</p>

<h4>What does this mean?</h4>

<p>Starting immediately we are introducing ads on the site, we hope they remain unobtrusive, yet prominent enough that they are useful to site visitors.
We are using Google ads so they are highly relevent to the page being viewed.</p>

<p>By the end of the day will have in place a checkout system, allowing visitors to purchase credits to be able to view photos.
 Contributors get 10 free credits for every photo uploaded.<br/>
 Note that however we intend to allow viewing of thumbnails for free.</p>

<p>Unfortunately if we don't raise enough funds within 2 weeks the site will have to close down.</p>
