How to update miniBB from 1.7 series to 2.0.
(c) miniBB.net
********************************************

New users should follow the installation process described in manual and not read below.

Subject is no warranty we give with this update process.

miniBB 2.0 first draft is created ONLY for mySQL users. If you are using not mySQL, keep your old version of forums this time.

You could follow alternative upgrade process described by our user Ivan here:

http://www.minibb.net/forums/index.php?action=vthread&forum=1&topic=1965#2

if you are not familiar with back-ups themselves and have no idea where to start from.

Our update instruction is the following:

*** Backup all your old files.

*** Backup your old database.

*** Open !updateDB.sql in some text editor and check, if your miniBB database table names are THE SAME as in this file (for example, 'minibb_forums' should correspond to actual forums information table, 'minibb_users' - to users table etc.)

*** Run !updateDB.sql file in your mySQL-manager (phpMyAdmin, mysqlFront, mysql command line etc.) - this file contains changes in mysql database structure.

*** Rewrite ALL *.php files, attached in installation archive, except for setup_options.php, bb_specials.php. Do not overwrite your templates and/or graphics.

*** Edit setup_options.php and add the following new settings which are NECESSARY for running new version of miniBB:

$enableNewRegistrations=TRUE; // if you want to enable new users register themselves; FALSE in another case
$enableProfileUpdate=TRUE; // if you want user would able to update their profiles themselves; FALSE in another case

/* With default miniBB database structure, keep the array below as it is given. Experienced users may find additional information in manual. */

$dbUserSheme=array(
'username'=>array(1,'username','login'),
'user_password'=>array(3,'user_password','passwd'),
'user_email'=>array(4,'user_email','email'),
'user_icq'=>array(5,'user_icq','icq'),
'user_website'=>array(6,'user_website','website'),
'user_occ'=>array(7,'user_occ','occupation'),
'user_from'=>array(8,'user_from','from'),
'user_interest'=>array(9,'user_interest','interest'),
'user_viewemail'=>array(10,'user_viewemail','user_viewemail'),
'user_sorttopics'=>array(11,'user_sorttopics','user_sorttopics'),
'language'=>array(14,'language','language'),
'user_custom1'=>array(16,'user_custom1','user_custom1'),
'user_custom2'=>array(17,'user_custom2','user_custom2'),
'user_custom3'=>array(18,'user_custom3','user_custom3')
);
$dbUserId='user_id';
$dbUserDate='user_regdate'; $dbUserDateKey=2;
$dbUserAct='activity';
$dbUserNp='user_newpasswd';
$dbUserNk='user_newpwdkey';

/* With default miniBB database structure, keep the array above as it is given. Experienced users may find additional information in manual. */

$indexphp='index.php?'; // for miniBB 2.0, the name of your index file is obligate. Don't forget to keep "?" after filename.
$useSessions=FALSE; // if you want to use both cookies and URL-sessions for user logging procedures, set to TRUE
$usersEditTopicTitle=TRUE; // if you want topic authors may edit their topic's title; else FALSE
$pathToFiles='./'; // general path to your miniBB files (RTFM for more)
//$includeHeader='header.php'; //uncomment and set alternate header, if you don't want to use miniBB's default main_header.html (useful if you use some header.php from your own site, for better integration).
//$includeFooter='footer.php'; // the same as above, for footer.
//$emptySubscribe=TRUE; // uncomment and set to TRUE if you want your users may subscribe to the topic without posting some text
$allForumsReg=TRUE; // if you want to make all forums for registered only users by one touch; else FALSE
//$registerInactiveUsers=TRUE; //if you want all registered users become inactive until you accept them. RTFM for more.

Edit the following OLD settings:

$dateFormat='j F Y H:i:s'; // now, the same as default PHP. Months are kept from language file and replaced to English month titles defined by 'F'.

$bb_admin='bb_admin.php?'; // add question sign at the end

This setting is REMOVED: $cookielang_exp

*** From a browser, run the file convdb.php - it will re-calculate all necessary new data, keeping your old data.

*** Edit the following files:

[x] templates/user_login_form.html - add new form field: <input type=hidden name=queryStr value="{$queryStr}"> 

[x] templates/main_last_discussions.html: remove the table cell(s) where {$l_views} was located (number of topic views is removed in miniBB2 because of speed). {$l_posted} replaced to {$l_lastAuthor} in the cell.

[x] templates/main_last_discuss_cell.html: add {$topic_reverse} for displaying reversed topic icon. Remove cell with {$numViews} in it. {$lastPoster} became "{$topicAuthor}<br><span class=txtSm>{$whenPosted}</span>", "<span class=txtSm>{$whenPosted}</span>" became "{$lastPoster}<br><span class=txtSm>{$lastPostDate}</span>". Because now we display both topic author and last poster in these cells.

[x] templates/main_topics.html: {$l_views} removed. {$l_posted} becomes {$l_lastAuthor} (the same as above).

[x] templates/main_topics_cell.html: Add {$topic_reverse}, eliminate {$numViews}, {$lastAuthor} becomes "{$topicAuthor}<br><span class=txtSm>{$whenPosted}</span>", "<span class=txtSm>{$whenPosted}</span>" becomes "{$lastPoster}<br><span class=txtSm>{$lastPostDate}</span>" (the same as above).

[x] templates/admin_searchusers.html, added form name: <form.... name=searchForm ...>, added new variable: {$delCheckBox} In a form tag, it becomes checkbox when searching for users who didn't make any post. It will be more easy to delete these users without additional prompt when cleaning your "dead users" table. Put it right after <li>, for example.

In admin_searchusers.html, the following code:

<input type=radio name=searchus value=id {$ci}> ID<br>
<input type=radio name=searchus value=email {$ce}> {$l_email} / {$l_sub_name}<br>
<input type=radio name=searchus value=inactive {$ca}> {$l_inactiveUsers}<br>
<input type=radio name=searchus value=registr {$cr}> {$l_haventReg}<br>

became simple dropdown:

{$whatDropDown}

[x] templates/admin_searchusersres.html - fix {$bb_admin} ONLY, so it looks like "{$bb_admin}action=..." not like "{$bb_admin}?action=".

[x] templates/admin_login.html - fix {$bb_admin} ONLY
[x] templates/admin_panel.html - fix {$bb_admin} ONLY

[x] teplates/main_post_area.html - remove $anchor and put it as hidden field: <INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=anchor VALUE="{$anchor}">

[x] templates/main_posts.html: insert new JS function confirmDelete(id,what) (take from the the origin). Now, when deleting topic or post, instead of confirmation page, you'll get confirmation JavaScript message. If you click Ok, message will be deleted, and you'll be re-addressed to the place when you started this operation. If you want, you may also update language $l_areYouSureDeleteTopic variable (insert \n as newline), so confirmation message will not look so big.

[x] templates/main_header.html: {$l_menu[8]} removed.

[x] templates/tools_delete_msg_warning.html, templates/tools_del_topic_warning.html: you can delete these templates completely.

[x] templates/email_user_register.txt - $userData[1] became $username, $userData[2] became $passwd

[x] templates/email_admin_userregister.txt - became: $row->$insres; $userData[1]->$username; $userData[4]->$user_email, $userData[5]->$user_icq; $userData[6]=$user_website; $userData[7]->$user_occ; $userData[8]->$user_from; $userData[9]->$user_interest

[x] templates/user_dataform.html: {$showemailDown} instead of showemail fields; {$sorttopicsDown} instead of sorttopics fields. New field {$languageDown} in user_dataform - correspondly to {$l_menu[8]} (language definition now is kept for each user individually).

[x] lang/[Your language file(s)]: delete the variables: $l_deleteLang, $l_chooseLang, $l_incorrect_tpl, $l_tpl_not_found, because they are not used anymore.

[x] img/topic_reverse.gif - NEW icon used for marking topics that are sorted in DESC order. New variable {$topic_reverse} appears in main_posts.html, main_last_discuss_cell.html, main_topics_cell.html (see original templates, where you can insert this variable).

*** If you done everything correctly, you must have your NEW miniBB version up and working.

********************************************
Changes comparision: 2.0 RC1a - 2.0 RC1b
********************************************
* index.php: minor changes regarding $action (done because of more efficient side-plugins include)
* bb_func_login.php: fixed error when anonymous user posts nothing when making new topic or post
* bb_functions.php: version change

Changes comparision: 2.0 RC1b - 2.0 RC1c
********************************************
* bb_functions.php: convert_date() fix

Changes comparision: 2.0 RC1c - 2.0 RC1d
********************************************
* Fixed templates: main_forums.html, main_last_discussions.html, main_topics.html, user_dataform.html ("images" directory was appearing incorrectly, the correct is "img").
* bb_functions.php: version change

Changes comparision: 2.0 RC1d - 2.0 RC1e
********************************************
* bb_func_usernfo.php: fixes in displaying user last posts. Added "limbb" class to <ul> tags.
* bb_default_style.css: added .limbb class for displaying lists in userinfo.
* setup_options.php: new option //$mod_rewrite=TRUE; Set if you want your main forum links displayed in "mod_rewrite" style. Only for Apache server! OBLIGATELY read our manual for more before using this option.
* bb_func_ldisc.php, bb_func_vtopic.php, bb_func_vthread.php, bb_functions.php: mod_rewrite issues.
* index.php: post-only forums issue.
* manual_eng.html: updated mod_rewrite issues

Changes comparision: 2.0 RC1e - 2.0 RC1f
********************************************
* setup_options.php: new array option $disallowNamesIndex (not obligate). Combined together with $disallowNames, allows to set list of prohibited usernames which cannot be used via user's registration. Example:

$disallowNamesIndex=array('admin');

When registering, both arrays are checked; the difference is that registration script checks $disallowNames as word fragments, and $disallowNamesIndex as full words. For example, if you have:

$disallowNames=array('admin');

users will not be able to register even under the name "badminton", because it contains the word inside $disallowNames. You need to put all exact words in $disallowNamesIndex.

Case doesn't matter in both arrays now.

* setup_options.php: new option $enableViews=TRUE; (not obligate). Because of many user requests, we put topic "Views" amount back, but you can disable it if you don't need this feature or it hangs up your database. If you are upgrading to RC1f from any of 2.x series, add new column in "topics" table, for example:

alter table minibb_topics add column topic_views int(10) default '0' not null after topic_time;

If you are upgrading from 1.x series, don't add this column. We have removed "drop" request from the !UPDATE_DB.sql file, so it will be kept in your database.

* bb_func_checkusr.php: new functions for checking $disallowNames and $disallowNamesIndex arrays in lowercase.
* bb_func_regusr.php: fixed bug with $closeRegister option.
* bb_admin.php: set_time_limit() issue
* bb_func_vthread.php: topic views issue
* bb_func_ldisc.php: topic views issue
* bb_func_vtopic.php: topic views issue
* bb_func_stats.php: topic views issue
* bb_functions.php: version change
* templates/manual_eng.html: updated
* templates/stats.html: topic views issue
* lang/eng.php: $l_stats_viewed re-added
* lang/eng.php: $l_stats_days_c changed back

* templates/main_last_discussions.html, templates/main_last_discuss_cell.html, templates/main_topics.html, templates/main_topics_cell.html: updated to have Views column again

Changes comparision: 2.0 RC1f - 2.0 RC1g
********************************************
* bb_func_vthread.php: fixes with moved topics IDs. Earlier, when you have bookmarked some topic, or received notification about that topic, if the topic was moved to another forum, you saw an error that this topic no longer exists. Now, it should work ok. Fixed also "Delete" link displaying in the first post.

* bb_func_vforum.php
* bb_func_stats.php,
* templates/stats.html (remove "Moderators" section): Moderators definition is CHANGED. Now, miniBB will have the same moderation routine as another forums - for every forum, you need to set up moderators separately. $mods array looks now as the following:

	$mods=array(
	FORUM_ID_1=>array(USER_ID_1, USER_ID_2, ...),
	FORUM_ID_2=>array(USER_ID_3, USER_ID_4, ...)
	...
	);

for example:

	$mods=array(
	1=>array(9,996),
	2=>array(9)
	);

means that user with ID = 9 is the moderator for forums with IDs 1 and 2, and user 996 is moderator for forum 1.

$modsOut variable, if existing, is not necessary anymore.

Displaying list of moderators is now available on the first forums page. In default version, it is hidden. If you want to display this list, in HTML template main_forums_cell.html add variable {$moderatorsList} (for example, directly after {$forum_desc}).

Moderators list was removed from the Stats script file and template.

* bb_admin.php: paths, URLs fix (as it was described here: http://www.minibb.net/forums/index.php?action=vthread&forum=3&topic=1974

* bb_func_editprf.php
* bb_func_inslng.php
* bb_func_login.php
* bb_func_man.php
* bb_func_ptopic.php
* bb_func_regusr.php
* bb_func_viewip.php
* bb_functions.php
* index.php
* _install.php

The following templates were updated so now they have {$main_url} variable instead of "./". It is NOT NECESSARY TO UPDATE these templates! If your previous version works Ok, and path to files is not critical for your server, ignore these files:

admin_panel.html
main_forums.html
main_forums_cell.html
main_header.html
main_lastdiscuss_cell.html (also added .views CSS style)
main_last_discussions.html (+ .views)
main_post_form.html
main_posts.html
main_topics.html (+ .views style)
main_topics_cell.html (+ .views style)
protect_forums.html
search.html
user_dataform.html

The following templates were updated as it was suggested by Ivan on 
http://www.minibb.net/forums/index.php?action=vthread&forum=1&topic=1978#4
(no need to update them if you are happy with layout!)

- admin_addforum1.html
- admin_searchusers.html
- lang/eng.php (just fixed some sentenses in English, nothing new here)

templates/manual_eng.html: manual updated.

$l_num_posts was deleted from language pack.

templates/main_forums.html : $l_num_posts changed to $l_replies

New CSS style in bb_default_style.css: .views (defines views column color in Last Discussions and Topics list)

We also have changed ISAM tables data type to myISAM. If your database tables are ISAM type, you can update them by the following mySQL command:

ALTER TABLE minibbtable_users TYPE = MYISAM;
ALTER TABLE minibbtable_topics TYPE = MYISAM;
ALTER TABLE minibbtable_posts TYPE = MYISAM;
ALTER TABLE minibbtable_send_mails TYPE = MYISAM;
ALTER TABLE minibbtable_forums TYPE = MYISAM;
ALTER TABLE minibbtable_banned TYPE = MYISAM;

This is not critical update and mostly does not affect critically the speed of your board in any case; but it is better to have myISAM tables type.
