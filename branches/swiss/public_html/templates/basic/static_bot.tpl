<h2>Geograph LinkCheck Bot information</h2>

<p>You've probably reached this page because our bot has visited your site, this is probably perfectly normal.</p>

<p>We use a simple bot to periodically check links that users have added into the description of their photos, we should check at most each url every 90 days. We will also endeavour to not check one website in quick succession.</p>

<p>If you observe any strange behaviour or our bot causes undue strain on your site, then please <a href="/contact.php">let us know</a> as soon as possible. The more detail you can provide the better, for example portions of the server log with our requests.</p>
 
<p>NOTE: We do not index or otherwise store the content of your website, simply check its apparent validity. Also we don't check robots.txt as we are only visiting specific URLs as provided on image descriptions entered by a person.</p>
