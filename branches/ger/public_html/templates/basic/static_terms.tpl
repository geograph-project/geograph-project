 <h2>Terms of use, the quick version</h2>

 <p>Lawyers, eh? Geograph Project Ltd's terms of use for the www.geograph.org.uk website can
 be boiled down to the following</p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>We'll do no evil</b> - we'll not sell your personal details to
 spammers or abuse the copyright on your submissions.</li>
 <li><b>We want you to do no evil to us</b>. Don't spider or
 leech the site, and be polite on the forums. Make sure you own the
 copyright on the images you submit and check the accuracy of the information you supply and/or choose to use.</li>
 <li>If evil has been done, <b>you agree not to come after us with a
 pack of lawyers</b>. We're just trying to build something worthwhile.
 <a href="/contact.php">Contact us</a> with your concerns.</li>

 </ul>

<p>Below is a somewhat lengthier expression of the above. Make a nice cup of
tea, put your feet up, and prepare to be riveted by a rollercoaster ride of legal
boilerplate...</p>
