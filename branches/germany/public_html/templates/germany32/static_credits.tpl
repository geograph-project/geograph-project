    <p>
    The idea for this site was born when I searched the web for pictures of some coastal features in Cornwall
    and found the <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/">Geograph British Isles</a> project. I was intrigued
    by the project's philosophy immediately, and I was wondering more and more why there is no such project for my
    region.
    </p>
    <p>
    However, I would have never been able to get such a project going on my own. I was lucky that the maintainers
    of <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/">www.geograph.org.uk</a> provided me generously with the source code
    and helped when I had problems and stupid questions. Thanks a lot, especially to
    Barry Hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
    Thanks for ideas and help with the German project go to <a href="http://geo.hlipp.de/profile/2">Stephen Hocker</a>
    and <a href="http://geo.hlipp.de/profile/3">Christian Lipp</a>. <a href="http://geo.hlipp.de/profile/325">Ulrich Meier</a>
    has done a lot of work improving the maps (e.g. lakes in Bavaria, coast lines). I wouldn't have been able to import
    all the information about counties and districts without his great help.
    He and
    <a href="http://geo.hlipp.de/profile/32">Sebastian Ballard</a> do most of the moderation which enables me to spend a bit more
    time on web development.
    </p>

    <h3>Borders</h3>

    <p>
    Most of the borders are taken from <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>.
    Many thanks also to <a href=http://www.geoclub.de/>geoclub</a> user "flopp" for his help.
    </p>

    <h3>Towns</h3>

    <p>
    The coordinates of the towns have been partially taken from <a href="http://opengeodb.hoppe-media.com/">OpenGeoDB</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Maps</h3>

    <p>
    Many thanks to "Nop" for allowing us to include the <a href="http://www.wanderreitkarte.de/">Wanderreitkarte</a> and

    from <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap data</a> provided by <a href="http://download.geofabrik.de/">GEOFABRIK</a> as
    a dataset reduced to German features.
    </p>

    <h3>Digital elevation model</h3>
