<h3>Geograph British Isles nominated for the New Statesman
New Media Awards 2007 for Education</h3>

<h4>12th April 2007</h4>

<p>The New Statesman, Britain’s leading political magazine, in association with Atos
Origin, the leading IT services company, announces the nomination of Geograph British Isles
in their New Media Awards in the category of Education award.
This award will go to the body or project that has made the most significant
contribution to education through the use of new media technology.</p>

<p>The key themes of this year’s awards are "accessibility, usability and interactivity".
The awards celebrate those who use new media for the benefit of others, whether in
their community or in society at large. Since 1998, these awards have promoted
projects that embrace new technology, fresh thinking and creative management in
the UK.</p>

<p>The Geograph British Isles is a web based project to collect geographically representative photographs and information for every square kilometre of the UK and the Republic of Ireland. All photos are licenced under a Creative Commons Licence, creating a unique archive of over 395,000 photos all available for reuse in a wide diverse range of projects</p> 

<p>The editor of the New Statesman, John Kampfner said: "<i>As the hits on our own
website, <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/newmedia">www.newstatesman.com</a>, have shot up by almost 150% since our recent relaunch,
we have seen first hand the power and potential inherent in the medium. We
are delighted to be able to champion those who are using technology to make a real
difference to society.</i>"</p>

<p>Geograph's curator, Gary Rogers thought this was wonderful news, "<i>Since the beginning we have been amazed at the interest in the project so much so that we now have over 4,300 contributors, sending in photos of very corner of our wonderful lands, ready to be viewed by over 7000 visitors a day. Getting nominated for this award can only help spread the word</i>".</p>
