  <li>To enter either Competition 
  you must upload at least one photograph that you have taken to the Website.  
  The photograph should be of one of the main geographical features within 
  an Ordnance Survey map’s one kilometre square grid (e.g. a close range 
  photograph of a building together with some of its surroundings, physical 
  landscape, geology or flora and fauna).  Any photograph you upload 
  must comply with the guidance on the Website at <a href="http://schools.geograph.org.uk/article/Geograph-or-supplemental" target="_blank"><u>http://schools.geograph.org.uk<WBR>/article/Geograph-or-supplement<WBR>al</u></a> and <a href="http://schools.geograph.org.uk/faq.php" target="_blank">http://schools.geograph.org.uk<WBR>/faq.php</a>.
