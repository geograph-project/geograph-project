The system folder contains system settings for replication to cluster servers

webserver - common configuration files for all webservers (e.g. scone, toast, crumpet)

dataserver - the main database server (eg jam) - also serves as the common hub for controlling the others

sphinxserver - the sphinx text search server(s) (eg tea)

proxyserver - the load balancer (eg tea)


NOTE: webserver should be setup for direct copying to webservers using config_cluster

whereas the others may have been stripped of passwords, so will need manually merging!
