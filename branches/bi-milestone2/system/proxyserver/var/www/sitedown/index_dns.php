<h1>Temporarily Offline</h1>

<p>Geograph is temporarily offline - some technical issues with our
DNS provider have broken the site. We're working to restore things
as soon as we possibly can!</p>

<p>Our DNS provider, 123-reg, have written:</p>

<p style="margin-left:30px;font-style:italic">
We are currently aware of a problem regarding 123-reg nameservers which in turn is affecting the visibility of websites and services such as email and web forwarding.
<br><br>

At present, we have engineers looking into this as a matter of urgency.
<br><br>

Please be assured we are working to rectify this issue as a priority and hope to resume normal service as soon as possible.
<br><br>

Thank you for your patience in the mean time.
<br><br>

We apologise for any inconvenience caused.
<br><br>
</p>

<p>Bear with us folks!</p>

<p><b>Update: Sat 13:45.</b> The issue has disappeared from 123-reg's status page, but we will wait until matters stabalize and we can be sure there was no damage before reopening.</p>

<p><b>Update: Sat 16:10. The issue is still ongoing and 123-reg's servers are not reliable. Its again listed as a issue (with the same wording as above) - so will just have to wait and see.</p>
