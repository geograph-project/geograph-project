<h2>Voting information</h2>
 
<p>Voting on geograph is an experimental feature. No promises we will use this data, however we hope that it be useful in some way.</p>

<p>A few points:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Voting is totally <b>anonymous</b>, and the data will never be used in any identifiable way. This includes letting others know you have voted at all.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>However voting <b>is</b> recorded against your account, to help eliminate duplicates.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>Only your <b>last</b> vote for a particular item will count.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>The 'average' is 3 - which is effectively the same as no vote at all.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>Note, you should approach voting with the aim to <b>promote the good stuff</b>, rather than root out and penalize the lower end of the scale.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>Similarly we will not use the data to highlight the lower end of the scale. I.e. we are more likely to take note of 4 and 5 star votes, and basically ignore 1 and 2 star votes.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>Your vote should always be personal, even if that is subjective, rather than what you think the majority would be.<br/><br/></li>
 </ul>
