<h3>What is Geographing?</h3>

	<ul>
	<li>It's a game - how many grid squares will you contribute?</li>
	<li>It's a geography project for the people</li>
	<li>It's a national photography project</li>
	<li>It's a good excuse to get out more!</li>
	<li>It's a free and <a href="#opensource">open online community</a> project for all</li>
	</ul>

<h3>What makes a good Geograph image?</h3>
	<ul>
<li>You must clearly show one of the main geographical features of the square</li>
	<li>You should include a short description relating the image to the map square</li>
	<li>Your submission makes a person who does not know this place think "Oh, that's how it looks there."</li>
	<li>Photographing a subject that could be useful to the child in interpreting a map</li>
	<li>The photo should also show some of the surroundings of the subject.</li>
	<li>We want to be fair when giving points:
		<ul>
		<li>The picture must be taken close to the subject, preferably in the same square. So, the rules here are not as strict as on <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk">www.geograph.org.uk</a> but you won't get many points by
		using your telephoto lens from a distant tower.</li>
		<li>If there is a possible subject in the foreground, you can't get points for another subject in the next square (no two points for simmilar pictures).</li>
		<li>The photographer location must not be some unusual "technical device" (plane, ...) if you want to get points. Pictures taken from a ship are okay, though.</li>
		</ul>
		Pictures which do not fulfill these criteria are still highly appreciated&mdash;you just won't get points for them (classification: "supplemental"). As these criteria have changed at the beginning, some old pictures might have been classified incorrectly, but this will be corrected gradually by remoderation.
		</li>
	</ul>

<div id="points">
<a name="points"></a>
<h3>How do I get a geograph point for my image?</h3>
	<p>If you're the first to submit a proper &quot;geograph&quot; for the grid square
	you'll get a geograph point added to your profile and the warm glow that comes
	with it.</p>
	
	<p>We welcome many Geograph images per square, so even if you don't get the point, you are still making a valuable contribution to the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="top"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div>

<div id="supplemental">	
<a name="supplemental"></a>
<h3>What is a supplemental image?</h3>
	<p>If an image doesn't quite fulfill the geograph criteria above, but is still a good
	image, we'll accept it as &quot;supplemental image&quot; - no geograph points are awarded,
	but the image will still appear on the selected grid square. A square that just contains
	supplemental images is still open to be claimed as a geograph though!</p>

	<!--p><img src="/templates/basic/img/icon_alert.gif" alt="Note" width="25" height="22" align="absmiddle"/> Follow this link for a <a title="geograph and supplemental guide" href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/article/Geograph-or-supplemental">more in depth discussion</a> on the finer points of moderation.</p-->
</div>

<div id="language">
<a name="language"></a>
<h3>Do you only accept descriptions in German?</h3>
<p>We also accept English descriptions and titles, which will be translated by a moderator if possible. We try to keep
the English version, too: we'll put it at the end of the title or description, enclosed in parentheses.</p>
</div>
<div class="top"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div>

<div id="multiple">
<a name="multiple"></a>
<h3>Do you accept multiple images per square?</h3>
	<p>Certainly - the points system is there to encourage people to make that extra effort 
	to capture squares we don't have photos for yet - but we welcome additional 
	geograph or supplemental images, perhaps showing a different subject, or a different time of year. Everyone sees 
	things differently - feel free to give us your take on any square. Some squares have 
	been done in considerable <a href="/statistics/most_geographed.php" title="squares with good overage">detail</a> - helping to more fully document and add <a href="/statistics/moversboard.php?type=depth" title="Depth Weekly Leaderboard">depth</a> to a square.</p>
</div>
<div class="top"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div>

<div id="resize">
<a name="resize"></a>
<h3>Do I need to resize my photos? Are there size limits?</h3>
	<p>You can upload images of any size, portrait or landscape, but we do resize them so their
	longest dimension is 640 pixels. We do not keep your original print quality image,
	only our resized screen-quality version.</p>

	<p>Ideally images shouldn't have the longest dimension less than 480 pixels, while we might accept such images if they hold particular interest, we would really prefer a larger image.</p>

	<p>We do preserve the EXIF headers from your original image, so it is
	advantageous to upload your original camera image if you want this information
	to be kept.</p>

<h3>I disagree with the location or title of an image - what can I do?</h3>

<h3>I would be interested in using Geograph content, is that possible?</h3>
	<p>Images are licensed for re-use under a <a href="#opensource">Creative Commons Licence</a>, see
	licence details by viewing a full size image. Also look for the "Interested in reusing this image?" link under each image on the main photo page, which outlines easy ways to reuse the image.</p>

	<p>Please get in <a title="Contact Us" href="/contact.php">contact</a> if you have an idea for reusing images,

<div id="opensource">
<a name="opensource"></a>
<h3>Open source? Creative Commons? What's that all about?</h3>
	<p>Putting this together requires many people to donate their
	time or resources, and we wanted to be sure that we created a resource
	free from commercial exploitation in future. To that end, the site software
	is available for re-use under the terms of the GNU Public Licence (GPL).</p>

	<ul>
	<li>If you want to get involved as a developer, <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/article/Geograph-for-Developers">see this article</a>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>In addition, we require all submitters to adopt a 
	{external href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/" text="Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike"} 
	licence on their photographic submissions (see next FAQ entry).
	</p>

	<p>In a nutshell, we wanted to build a true community project that won't 
	leave a nasty taste in the mouth by getting sold for shedloads of cash and
	taken away from the people who contributed. These licence terms ensure that the
	site and content can never be "taken away" from you. See <a href="/help/freedom">Freedom - The Geograph Manifesto</a>

<div class="top"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div>

<div id="licence">
<a name="licence"></a>
<h3>How can my images get reused?</h3>
	<p>We require all submitters to adopt a 
	{external href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/" text="Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike"} 
	licence on their photographic submissions. While our volunteer photographers
	keep copyright on their photos, they also grant the use of their photographs
	in return for attribution (take a look at a <a title="View a typical photograph" href="/photo/1">typical 
	submission</a> for more details).</p>
	<p>In a nutshell: Everyone is allowed to use all submitted photographs he/she wants, <b>but</b>
	he must tell who took the photograph <b>and</b> he/she can redistribute a derived work only under
	the same licence conditions as the original photograph.</p>
	<p>Quite similar to other free projects as Wikipedia or Linux, this also allows commercial use
	(e.g. a newspaper could use your picture), but the licence guarantees that you are attributed
	as copyright holder and that your work and any derived work must be distributed only under
	this free licence.
	</p>
	<p>Granting everyone the same rights actually protects the site community
	from exploitation (see previous FAQ entry), but do bear in mind that we only
	retain a screen-quality version of your image, and that under the terms of 
	the Creative Commons licence, you must be credited for any use of your image</p>

<h3>Why is Germany divided, again? What coordinates do you use?</h3>
	<p>We basically use <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGRS">MGRS/UTMREF coordinates</a>
	which means that Germany is divided into the three UTM zones 31, 32, 33. More details about this topic can be

<div id="aol">
<a name="aol"></a>
<h3>I use AOL, and the images look terrible!</h3>
	<p>AOL's default settings for graphics is to show &quot;Compressed Graphics Only&quot;. 
	This means AOL is selectively <i>re-compressing</i> images before you see them on your
	screen. This loses a lot of image quality.</p>

	<p>You should reset the preferences under &quot;My AOL/Preferences/WWW&quot; to display 
	&quot;Uncompressed Graphics&quot;. You will pay only a small penalty in download time to see 
	this and other photo oriented sites the way everyone else can see them.</p>

<div class="top"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div>

<div id="missing">
<a name="missing"></a>
<h3>Many thumbnails seem to be missing, any idea of the cause?</h3>
	<p>Some firewall programs, in particular Norton Internet Security, block images that are the same size as some common advertisements. Unfortunately many thumbnails and some map images happen to be this exact size.</p>

	<p>So if you use such a program you might like to try turning it off temporarily and trying again, and if that gets our images back, then have a look for the option to disable this, arguably, flawed method of security.</p>
