Use one OR other of these two files. not both. 


geograph.conf goes in global Apache configuration, if you have that level of access to the server. 

eg on ubuntu could put in /etc/apache2/sites-available/ and then put a symlink in etc/apache2/sites-enabled/
on rhel based linux could put in /etc/httpd/conf.d/



Otherwise if on shared hosing use .htaccess  and put it in the public_html folder.
