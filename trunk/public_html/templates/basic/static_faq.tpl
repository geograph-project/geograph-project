<a name="geograph"></a>
<h3>So what makes a geograph?</h3>
	<ul>

<li>You must clearly show at close range one of the main geographical features within the square</li>
<li>You should include a short description relating the image to the map square</li>
<li>The image should be a natural image as a human would see it, please avoid digitally altering the image to add dates, texts etc, or creating montages, similarly turn off date stamping performed by a camera. A little tweaking of brightness/contrast and/or cropping is fine and encouraged. </li>
<li>The image subject must be within the claimed grid square, and ideally the photographer should be too.</li>

	</ul>


<h3>What is a first geograph?</h3>
	<p>If you're the first to submit a proper &quot;geograph&quot; for the grid square
	you'll get a geograph point added to your profile and the warm glow that comes
	with it. </p>

<a name="supplemental"></a>
<h3>What is a supplemental image?</h3>
	<p>If an image doesn't quite fulfill the geograph criteria above, but is still a good
	image, we'll accept it as &quot;supplemental image&quot; - no geograph points are awarded,
	but the image will still appear on the selected grid square. A square that just contains
	supplemental images is still open to be claimed as a first geograph though!
	</p>

<a name="multiple"></a>
<h3>Do you accept multiple images per square?</h3>
	<p>Certainly - the points system is there to encourage people to make that extra effort 
	to capture squares we don't have photos for yet - but we welcome additional 
	geograph or supplemental images, perhaps showing a different subject, or a different time of year. Everyone sees 
	things differently - feel free to give us your take on any square. Some squares have 
	been done in considerable <a href="/statistics/most_geographed.php" title="squares with good overage">detail</a> - helping to more fully document and add <a href="/moversboard.php?type=depth" title="Depth Weekly Leaderboard">depth</a> to a square.</p>
