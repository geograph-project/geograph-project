<p>Ordnance Survey, the national mapping agency of Great Britain, is to sponsor 
the non-profit Geograph Project Ltd to improve and maintain the www.geograph.org.uk website and 
further develop its educational potential.</p>

<p>Since the Geograph website went live in April 2005, it has collected over 160,000 
Creative-Commons licensed photographs of the British Isles. In addition, it has created 
a vibrant and friendly community of contributors dedicated to the goal of building 
an archive of photographs covering every square kilometre of the British Isles. The
site recently celebrated filling its 100,000th grid square.</p>

<p>The two-year sponsorship deal will mean a vast improvement in the capability of 
the computer hardware used to provide the website. Furthermore, from autumn 2006 the 
site will include up-to-date 1:50000 scale maps from Ordnance Survey.</p>

<p>Site developers Gary Rogers, Paul Dixon and Barry Hunter have formed the non-profit 
company Geograph Project Ltd to represent the site, and will continue to develop it, 
particularly with respect to its use in education.</p>

<p>Gary Rogers, who came up with the original idea for Geograph, said 
&quot;<i>I'm very excited about Ordnance Survey's support, it will help us to ensure that 
Geograph 
becomes as useful to the educational community as it possibly can be&quot;.</i></p>

<p>Ordnance Survey liaison for the project, Darren Bailey, was equally pleased 
&quot;<i>it's incredible what Geograph and its contributors have put together, 
we're looking forward to helping this community-driven effort in building a 
useful and lasting educational resource</i>&quot;.</p>
