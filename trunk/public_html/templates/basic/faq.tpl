<h3>What is Geographing?</h3>
	<p>See our <a title="guide to geographing" href="/help/guide">guide to good geographing</a></p>

<a name="points"></a>
<h3>How do I get a geograph point for my image?<br/> What makes a good geograph?</h3>
	<p>If you're the first to submit a proper &quot;geograph&quot; for the grid square
	you'll get a geograph point added to your profile and the warm glow that comes
	with it. So what makes an image a genuine geograph?</p>
	<ul>
	<li>You must clearly show at close range one of the main geographical features within the square</li>
	<li>You should include a short description relating the image to the map square</li>
	</ul>
	<p>See <a title="geograph and supplemental guide" href="/help/geograph_guide">What is a geograph?</a> 
	for more details.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>We welcome many Geograph images per square, so even if you don't get the point, you are still making a valuable contribution to the project.</li>
	</ul>

<a name="supplemental"></a>
<h3>What is a supplemental image?</h3>
	<p>If an image doesn't quite fulfill the geograph criteria above, but is still a good
	image, we'll accept it as &quot;supplemental image&quot; - no geograph points are awarded,
	but the image will still appear on the selected grid square. A square that just contains
	supplemental images is still open to be claimed as a geograph though! See <a 
	title="geograph and supplemental guide" href="/help/geograph_guide">What is a geograph?</a> 
	for details of how photos are moderated.
	</p>

<a name="multiple"></a>
<h3>Do you accept multiple images per square?</h3>
	<p>Certainly - the points system is there to encourage people to make that extra effort 
	to capture squares we don't have photos for yet - but we welcome additional 
	geograph or supplemental images, perhaps showing a different subject, or a different time of year. Everyone sees 
	things differently - feel free to give us your take on any square. Some squares have 
	been done in considerable <a href="/statistics/most_geographed.php" title="squares with good overage">detail</a> - helping to more fully document and add <a href="/moversboard.php?type=depth" title="Depth Weekly Leaderboard">depth</a> to a square.</p>

<a name="resize"></a>
<h3>Do I need to resize my photos? Are there size limits?</h3>
	<p>You can upload images of any size, portrait or landscape, but we do resize them so their
	longest dimension is 640 pixels. We do not keep your original print quality image,
	only our resized screen-quality version.</p>

	<p>Ideally images shouldn't have the longest dimension less than 480 pixels, while we might accept such images if they hold particular interest, we would really prefer a larger image.</p>

	<p>We do preserve the EXIF headers from your original image, so it is
	advantageous to upload your original camera image if you want this information
	to be kept.</p>

<a name="change"></a>
<h3>I disagree with the location or title of an image - what can I do?</h3>
	<p>Our <a href="/help/changes">"Change Request Tickets"</a> allow any registered user 
	to suggest a change of grid reference or title/comment
	information - simply view the full size image and click the "report a problem" link.
	</p>

<a name="legal"></a>
<h3>What are my legal rights when taking photographs?</h3>
	<p>Let's preface this by stating <b>We Are Not Lawyers</b>, and if you have any doubts
	about your right to take picture, then you're probably better off not submitting it to us.
	However, there is a 
	{external href="http://www.sirimo.co.uk/ukpr.php" text="useful guide"}
	available which outlines your rights in the UK fairly concisely. 
	</p>

<a name="aol"></a>
<h3>I use AOL, and the images look terrible!</h3>
	<p>AOL's default settings for graphics is to show &quot;Compressed Graphics Only&quot;. 
	This means AOL is selectively <i>re-compressing</i> images before you see them on your
	screen. This loses a lot of image quality.</p>

	<p>You should reset the preferences under &quot;My AOL/Preferences/WWW&quot; to display 
	&quot;Uncompressed Graphics&quot;. You will pay only a small penalty in download time to see 
	this and other photo oriented sites the way everyone else can see them.</p>

<a name="counties"></a>
<h3>Counties, I'm confused, which do you display?</h3>
	<p>We use county information to aid recognition of place names on photo pages and other areas of the site, like helping to disambiguate search terms (e.g. a search for "Gillingham")</p>
	
	<p>For Ireland, it's simple; we just use the traditional counties. Great Britain isn't so easy, which has seen three <i>major</i> county structures;</p>

	<dl class="picinfo">
		<dt>Ceremonial Counties (sometimes known as Geographic)</dt>
		<dd>These were introduced in 1974 primarily as a way to define areas for County Councils. Although these are possibly what most people recognize as counties, a suitable dataset to allow us to use these counties would be too costly for us to bear. So we must compromise a little...</dd>

		<dt>Administrative Counties (also known as District/Unitary Authorities)</dt>
		<dd>These are the modern 'counties' in use by the current government (since 1997). This is the best dataset we have available, so we display it prominently in the gazetteer line on photo pages. It is also useful for identifying the council responsible for the area. However for large towns/cities, for example Sheffield, which are in their own Authority (therefore the 'county' of Sheffield), we attempt to be clever and display the Historic County instead.</dd>

		<dt>Historic Counties</dt>
		<dd>These are the counties that have evolved over many hundreds of years and were in active use until 1974. We use this data as a fallback - where we've opted to display the administrative country on a photo page, you can often find the historic county by hovering over this title.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>For a more in depth explanation, see {external href="http://www.abcounties.org.uk/" text="abcounties.org.uk"}. <span class="nowrap">(however beware that the site doesn't use the exact same terms)</span></p>

<a name="rss"></a>
<h3>Do you have an RSS feed?</h3>
	<p>RSS, or Really Simple Syndication, allows you to obtain an up-to-date listing of
	the latest geograph submissions for integration into another website or RSS reader. For more information,
	try this {external href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(protocol)" text="Wikipedia article on RSS"}.</p>

	<p>We provide an RSS1.0 feed at 
	<a title="Geograph RSS feed" href="http://{$http_host}/syndicator.php">http://{$http_host}/syndicator.php</a>
	which contains links to the latest 20 moderated images. </p>

	<p>The feed is also available in

	formats.</p>

	<p>We have recently added RSS feeds to other parts of the site. You will find an <a class="xml-rss">RSS</a> button at the bottom of search results, useful to keep updated on local images. Registered users can access RSS feed of the latest Topics in the Discussion Forum, and even subscribe to an individual Topic, just look for the <a class="xml-rss">RSS</a> button! (they also accept the format parameter like the main feed, the Grid Square Discussions even supports <a class="xml-geo" title="Geograph Grid Square Discussions" href="http://{$http_host}/discuss/syndicator.php?forum=5&amp;format=GeoRSS">GeoRSS</a>.)</p>

	<p>If you use the {external title="Firefox Web Browser" href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/" text="Firefox"} web browser, 
	you should be able use our feeds as "live bookmarks" - simply
	click the orange button in the address bar (or in the status bar on older versions).</p>    

<a name="use"></a>
<h3>I would be interested in using Geograph content, is that possible?</h3>
	<p>If you can think of an interesting use on your own site, or for a new idea, (beyond what's available via the RSS feeds above) 
	then we would be very interested to <a title="Contact Us" href="contact.php">hear from you</a>. 
	In all likelihood we can provide a feed to suit your requirements.</p>

<a name="built"></a>
<h3>Who built this marvellous site?</h3>
	<p>Please see the <a href="/help/credits" title="Credits Page">Credits Page</a> for
	information on all the <a href="/admin/team.php">people</a> who make this site possible.</p>

<a name="opensource"></a>
<h3>Open source? Creative Commons? What's that all about?</h3>
	<p>Putting this together requires many people to donate their
	time or resources, and we wanted to be sure that we created a resource
	free from commercial exploitation in future. To that end, the site
	{external title="geograph source code" href="http://geograph.sourceforge.net" text="source code"} is available 
	for re-use under the terms of the GNU Public Licence (GPL).</p>

	<p>In addition, we require all submitters to adopt a 
	{external href="http://creativecommons.org" text="Creative Commons"} 
	licence on their photographic submissions. While our volunteer photographers
	keep copyright on their photos, they also grant the use of their photographs
	in return for attribution (take a look at a <a title="View a typical photograph" href="/photo/14">typical 
	submission</a> for more details)</p>

	<p>In a nutshell, we wanted to build a true community project that won't 
	leave a nasty taste in the mouth by getting sold for shedloads of cash and
	taken away from the people who contributed. Our licence terms ensure that the
	site and content can never be "taken away" from you.
	</p>

<a name="commercial"></a>
<h3>Why must I agree to allow commercial use of my image?</h3>
	<p>Running this site costs money, particularly over time as the storage
	requirements are quite large. We require commercial rights to enable us to
	support the running costs. One way we may do this is through sales of 
	montage posters once we reach a critical mass of submissions.</p>

	<p>Granting everyone the same rights actually protects the site community
	from exploitation (see previous FAQ entry), but do bear in mind that we only
	retain a screen-quality version of your image, and that under the terms of 
	the Creative Commons licence, you must be credited for any use of your image</p>
