    <h2>FAQ</h2>
 
    <h3>What is Geographing?</h3>
    <p>See our <a title="guide to geographing" href="/help/guide">handy guide</a></p>
    
    <h3>Who built this marvellous site?</h3>
    <p>Please see the <a href="/help/credits" title="Credits Page">Credits Page</a> for
    information on all the people who made this site possible.</p>
 
    <h3>Open source? Creative Commons? What's that all about?</h3>
    <p>Putting this together requires many people to donate their
    time or resources, and we wanted to be sure that we created a resource
    free from commercial exploitation in future. To that end, the site
    <a title="geograph source code" href="http://geograph.sourceforge.net">source code</a> is available 
    for re-use under the terms of the GNU Public Licence (GPL).</p>
    
    <p>In addition, we require all submitters to adopt a 
    <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> 
    licence on their photographic submissions. While our volunteer photographers
    keep copyright on their photos, they also grant the use of their photographs
    in return for attribution (take a look at a submission for more details)</p>
    
    <p>In a nutshell, we wanted to build a true community project that won't 
    leave a nasty taste in the mouth by getting sold for shedloads of cash.
