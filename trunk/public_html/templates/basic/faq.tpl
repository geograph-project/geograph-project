    <h2>FAQ</h2>
 
<h3>What is Geographing?</h3>
    <p>See our <a title="guide to geographing" href="/help/guide">guide to good geographing</a></p>
    
<a name="points"></a>    
<h3>How do I get a geograph point for my image? What makes a good geograph?</h3>
    
    <p>If you're the first to submit a proper &quot;geograph&quot; for the grid square
    you'll get a geograph point added to your profile and the warm glow that comes
    with it. So what makes an image a genuine geograph?</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The image must be taken within the grid square </li>
    <li>You must clearly show at close range one of the main geographical features within the square</li>
    <li>You should include a short description relating the image to the map square</li>
    </ul>
    <p>See the <a title="guide to geographing" href="/help/guide">guide to good geographing</a> 
    for more details</p>

<h3>What is a supplemental image?</h3>
    <p>If an image doesn't quite fulfill the geograph criteria above, but is still a good
    image, we'll accept it as &quot;supplemental image&quot; - no geograph points are awarded,
    but the image will still appear on the selected grid square. A square that just contains
    supplemental images is still open to be claimed as a geograph though!
    </p>

<h3>Do I need to resize my photos? Are there size limits?</h3>
    <p>You can upload images of any size, portrait or landscape, but we do resize them so their
    longest dimension is 640 pixels. We do not keep your original print quality image,
    only our resized screen-quality version.</p>
    
    <p>We do preserve the EXIF headers from your original image, so it is
    advantageous to upload your original camera image if you want this information
    to be kept.</p>
    

<h3>Who built this marvellous site?</h3>
    <p>Please see the <a href="/help/credits" title="Credits Page">Credits Page</a> for
    information on all the people who made this site possible.</p>
 
<h3>Open source? Creative Commons? What's that all about?</h3>
    <p>Putting this together requires many people to donate their
    time or resources, and we wanted to be sure that we created a resource
    free from commercial exploitation in future. To that end, the site
    <a title="geograph source code" href="http://geograph.sourceforge.net">source code</a> is available 
    for re-use under the terms of the GNU Public Licence (GPL).</p>
    
    <p>In addition, we require all submitters to adopt a 
    <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> 
    licence on their photographic submissions. While our volunteer photographers
    keep copyright on their photos, they also grant the use of their photographs
    in return for attribution (take a look at a <a title="View a typical photograph" href="/view.php?id=14">typical 
    submission</a> for more details)</p>
    
    <p>In a nutshell, we wanted to build a true community project that won't 
    leave a nasty taste in the mouth by getting sold for shedloads of cash and
    taken away from the people who contributed. Our licence terms ensure that the
    site and content can never be "taken away".
    </p>
    
<h3>Why must I agree to allow commercial use of my image?</h3>
    <p>Running this site costs money, particularly over time as the storage
    requirements are quite large. We require commercial rights to enable us to
    support the running costs. One way we may do this is through sales of 
    montage posters once we reach a critical mass of submissions.</p>
    
    <p>Granting everyone the same rights actually protects the site community
    from exploitation (see previous FAQ entry), but do bear in mind that we only
    retain a screen-quality version of your image, and that under the terms of 
    the Creative Commons licence, you must be credited for any use of your image</p>
