<h2>Suggesting changes to picture information</h2>

<p>If you view an image and feel the coordinates or picture information
is incorrect, you can suggest changes simply by clicking the 
"report a problem" link when viewing the full size image.</p>

<p>Read on for more details about what happens when you suggest a change</p>


<h3>Changing your own images</h3>
<p>If you suggest a change to one of your own images, the changes will
take effect right away, with the exception of changing the grid reference.</p>

<p>If you change the grid reference of the photo, a "change ticket" is raised
and a moderator will be notified.
When the moderator closes the ticket, you will receive an email.</p>


<h3>Changing other images</h3>
<p>You can suggest a change to someone elses image too - 
all such changes are moderated.</p>

<p>When you submit a change request, the owner of the photo recieves
a notification that a change has been suggested, and a moderator is alerted too.</p>

<p>From this point on, you won't hear anything until the change ticket is closed,
when you'll get a email and a list of changes made, and the closing comments
of the moderator. The owner of the photo is also entirely unaware who has suggested 
the change, unless you choose to identify yourself in your change comment.</p>


<h3>Commenting on changes to your images</h3> 
<p>If a change ticket has been raised on one of your images, you may wish to comment
on it - simply follow the link in the notification email, and you can leave a
comment which is sent to the moderators.</p>

<p>When investigating the changes, the moderator may have a query, and they'll
leave a comment inviting you to respond. You will get an email notification when
this happens. Again, simply follow the link and leave your response as a comment.</p>


<h3>Notification emails about tickets on your images</h3>
<p>By default you get a notification message when a ticket is created, when a moderator
leaves a comment, and when the ticket is closed. Recently we have added the option of 
the suggestor to flag a ticket as minor, which is suggested for use on typo corrections
for example.</p>

<p>You can in your profile, choose to opt out of receiveing notifications of new tickets, 
and the closure notifications, (and optionally only on minor tickets). In this way you can
cut down on the volumn of emails, and just let a moderator deal with the ticket. Note that 
at in all cases as the photographer, you can always revert any change you don't agree with.</p>


<h3>Viewing current and closed change tickets</h3> 
<p>The change request page also allows you to view details of current and closed
change tickets. If the picture is yours, you can see full details and are
able to leave comments. For someone else's picture, all you see is the original 
change request.</p>

<p>You can also find a list of <a href="/tickets.php">recent tickets</a> on your own 
images, using the link at the bottom of your profile page.</p>
