<h2>Suggesting changes to picture information</h2>

<p>If you view an image and feel the coordinates or picture information
is incorrect, you can suggest changes simply by clicking the 
"report a problem" link when viewing the full size image.</p>

<p>Read on for more details about what happens when you suggest a change</p>


<h3>Changing your own images</h3>
<p>If you suggest a change to one of your own images, the changes will
take effect right away, with the exception of changing the grid reference.</p>

<p>If you change the grid reference of the photo, a "change ticket" is raised
and a moderator will be notified.
When the moderator closes the ticket, you will receive an email.</p>

<h3>Changing other images</h3>
<p>You can suggest a change to someone elses image too - 
all such changes are moderated</p>

<p>When you submit a change request, the owner of the photo recieves
a notification that a change has been suggested, and a moderator is alerted too</p>

<p>From this point on, you won't hear anything until the change ticket is closed,
when you'll get a thankyou email and a list of changes made. The owner of the
photo is also entirely unaware who has suggested the change, unless you
choose to identify yourself in your change comment.</p>

<h3>Commenting on changes to your images</h3> 

<p>If a change ticket has been raised on one of your images, you may wish to comment
on it - simply follow the link in the notification email, and you can leave a
comment which is sent to the moderators.</p>

<p>When investigating the changes, the moderator may have a query, and they'll
leave a comment inviting you to respond. You will get an email notification when
this happens. Again, simply follow the link and leave your response as a comment.</p>


<h3>Viewing current and closed change tickets</h3> 
<p>The change request page also allows you to view details of current and closed
change tickets. If the picture is yours, you can see full details and are
able to leave comments. For someone else's picture, all you see is the original 
change request</p>
