<h2>Suggesting changes to picture information</h2>

<p>If you view an image and feel the coordinates or picture information
is incorrect, you can suggest changes simply by clicking the 
"Suggest an update to picture details"/"Edit picture information" link when viewing the full size image.</p>

<p>Read on for more details about what happens when you suggest a change</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Changing your own images</h3>
<p>If you suggest a change to one of your own images, the changes will
take effect right away, with the exception of changing the grid reference.</p>

<p>If you change the subject grid square of the photo, a "change ticket" is raised
and a moderator will be notified.
When the moderator closes the ticket, you will receive an email.</p>

<p>Similarlly if you add a comment without making any changes, a "change ticket" is raised
and a moderator will be notified.</p>

<p>In certain cases you can use the 'Image Self Moderation' section to suggest a status for an image, 
if the image is still pending then the moderator will see the suggestion, just like ticking the box during submission.
You can also use this to request rejection of an image submitted in error. Once the image has been moderated you
can also suggest a further moderation, in which case a moderator will revisit your image and may offer feedback.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Changing other images</h3>
<p>You can suggest a change to someone elses image too - 
all such changes are moderated.</p>

<p>When you submit a change request, the owner of the photo receives
a notification that a change has been suggested, and a moderator is alerted too.</p>

<p>From this point on, you won't hear anything until the change ticket is closed unless a 
moderator has a question. Otherwise you'll get a notification of the ticket been closed 
and a list of changes made, including the closing comments of the moderator. 

<p><i>The owner of the photo is also entirely unaware who has suggested 
the change, unless you choose to identify yourself in your change comment.</i></p>

<hr/>

<h3>Commenting on changes to your images</h3> 
<p>If a change ticket has been raised on one of your images, you may wish to comment
on it - simply follow the link in the notification email, and you can leave a
comment which is sent to the moderators.</p>

<p>When investigating the changes, the moderator may have a query, and they'll
leave a comment inviting you to respond. You will get an email notification when
this happens. Again, simply follow the link and leave your response as a comment.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Notification emails about tickets on your images</h3>
<p>By default you get a notification message when a ticket is created, when a moderator
leaves a comment, and when the ticket is closed. Recently we have added the option of 
the suggestor to flag a ticket as minor, which is suggested for use on typo corrections
for example.</p>

<p>You can in your profile, choose to opt out of receiving notifications of new tickets, 
and the closure notifications, (and optionally only on minor tickets). In this way you can
cut down on the volume of emails, and just let a moderator deal with the ticket.

<p><i>Note that 
at in all cases as the photographer, you can always revert any change you don't agree with.</i></p>

<hr/>

<h3>Viewing current and closed change tickets</h3> 
<p>The change request page also allows you to view details of current and closed
change tickets. If the picture is yours, you can see full details and are
able to leave comments. For someone else's picture, all you see is the original 
change request.</p>

<p>You can also find a list of <a href="/tickets.php">recent tickets</a> on your own 
images, using the link at the bottom of your profile page.</p>
