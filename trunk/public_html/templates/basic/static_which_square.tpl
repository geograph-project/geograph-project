<h2>Which square should a photo be submitted for?</h2>

<p>If you are new to the site, please have a look at our <a href="/help/guide">guide</a> 
first which should help you get started. The information below give guidence when unsure 
on which square to submit for.</p>

<h3 style="background:#bbbbbb; padding:5px;">Closeup Shots</h3>

<p style="background:#dddddd; padding:5px;font-weight:bold;">Photos of builings etc...</p>
<ul>
<li>Should be submitted for the subject location.</li>
<li>If you can specify the photographer position then please do so (if its different to the subject location to the percision that you are working to...), its fine if you are standing just over a gridline border.</li>

<li>If marked on map then use that position. (can be confirmed up by GPS position, but take the map as more difinitive)</li>
<li>Even though these are closeups the should include a little of the area to show contect</li>
</ul>

<p style="background:#dddddd; padding:5px;font-weight:bold;">Wider Angle shots such as fields and woodlands</p>
<ul>
<li>Should be submitted the approximate center of the image (or prominent feature)</li>
</ul>

<p style="background:#dddddd; padding:5px;font-weight:bold;">Macro shots of stones, flowers etc</p>
<ul>
<li>Should be submitted for the subject location, if all possible specify to at least 6 figures</li>
<li>Most likly to be supplemental images.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="background:#bbbbbb; padding:5px;">Wide Angle Views</h3>

<p style="background:#dddddd; padding:5px;font-weight:bold;">Wide angle shots that cover a wide area,  depicting a prominent feature but not including any foreground detail</p>
<ul>
<li>Should be submitted (to the square of) and documented as the <i>primary subject</i> of the picture.</li>
<li>If at all possible specify the photographer position in the separate box.</li>
<li>If the feature covers many grid-squares, an appropriate one should be chosen (e.g. the mountain peak) and that fact noted in the comments.</li>
<li>Will probably be classed as supplemental.</li>
</ul>

<p style="background:#dddddd; padding:5px;font-weight:bold;">Wide angle shots that don't have a prominent feature, including panoramas </p>
<ul>
<li>Should be submitted for the photographer location, 'as the view from the square'.</li>
<li>When taking these shots try to include foreground detail to give context, if no foreground consider are suitable for geograph? (Would you be able to use the picture to stand in the same spot?)</li>
<li>The location should be duplicated in the photographer position box reinforse this known location</li>
</ul>

<p style="background:#dddddd; padding:5px;font-weight:bold;">Wide angle shots that include foreground detail <br/>(even if a 'prominent' subject is visible) </p>
<ul>
<li>Should be submitted for the foreground detail square, and that detailed as the subject (title etc...)</li>
<li>The photographer grid ref should still be specified (as the same location)</li>
<li>The comments can then mention the feature(s) visible in the background.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="background:#bbbbbb; padding:5px;">Telephoto shots</h3>

<p style="background:#dddddd; padding:5px;font-weight:bold;">Telephoto shots of a distant location</p>
<ul>
<li>These should definitely have the photographer location specified, but submitted for the subject location.</li>
<li>If the subject is not location specific then it might be rejected, similarlly subjects out at sea.</li>
</ul>

<p style="background:#eeeeee; padding:5px;"><i>'Geograph' images should be all about getting into the square and taking close up shots of the detail. The wide angle views are fine as backup, but not the main images.</i></p>
