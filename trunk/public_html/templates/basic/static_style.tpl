<h2>Title and Comments - Style Guide</h2>

<p style="color:#990000;font-size:0.8em">Note: This is only a recommended guide, submitted via the <a href="/discuss/index.php?&action=vthread&forum=3&topic=1157">Forum</a>.</p>

<p>Sentence case is recommended for titles and comments, with only the first character capitalised. However, capitalise proper nouns (names of people, organisations or places), postcodes or grid references.</p>

<p>Titles should not have a full stop. Comments should be fully punctuated.</p>

<h3>Title examples:</h3>

<p>Peacock butterfly on teasles, near Towersey</p>

<p>Peacock in the grounds of the Old Mill</p>

<p>Warwick Castle - the Peacock Garden</p>

<h3>Comment examples:</h3>

<p>Windmill Hill, site of the battle of Vinegar Hill 1798, offers astonishing views in all directions. The site is 1km east of Enniscorthy.</p>

<p>The landscape at the north east end of the Vale of Belvoir is flat; in this square it only ranges from about 28-31 metres above sea level. The hedge line on the horizon is the county boundary with Leicestershire.</p>
