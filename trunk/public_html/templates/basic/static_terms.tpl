 <h2>Terms of use, the quick version</h2>

 <p>Lawyers, eh? This is an entirely volunteer run project and our terms can
 be boiled down to the following</p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>We'll do no evil</b> - we'll not sell your personal details to
 spammers or abuse the copyright on your submissions.</li>
 <li><b>We want you to do no evil too</b>. Don't spider or
 leech the site, and be polite on the forums. Make sure you own the
 copyright on the images you submit.</li>
 <li>If evil has been done, <b>you agree not to come after us with a
 pack of lawyers</b>. We're just volunteers trying to build something worthwhile.
 <a href="/contact.php">Contact us</a> with your concerns.</li>

 </ul>

<p>Below is a somewhat lengthier expression of the above. Make a nice cup of
tea, put your feet up, and prepare to be riveted by a rollercoaster ride of legal
boilerplate...</p>
