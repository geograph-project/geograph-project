    <h2>Grid Reference Precision</h2>
 
<p>During the submission process and on the final photo page we feature a small extract from 1:50,000 Landranger&trade; raster mapping, unfortunatly due to the scale the accuacy isn't as great as other mapping.</p>

<p>Because of this while we record a 8 figure grid reference when dragging the map markers, this actully implies accuacy that isnt available, so we offer the option to only display a 6 figure grid reference on the photo page. (this might be transparently enforced in the future)</p>
