<h2>Imagine Slideshow</h2>

<p>As well as the standard search results methods we have created a new display specially designed for use in the classroom. 
In this mode each result is first shown as just a map, at which point you ask the class to visualise the spot highlighted, 
then click a button to reveal the photo at the point so see how it matches up.</p>

<p>As this is part of the search results, it can visualise any images on the site, that match a certain criteria or you can even hand select the images you wish to use. </p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>We have created this <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/search.php?i=1796032&displayclass=reveal">quick example</a> of its use, but see below how to create your own</p>

<h3>Standard Searches</h3>

Either

<ul><li>Use the Advanced Search to create a custom search, and at the bottom of the page select the format 'map imagine slideshow'</li></ul>

or 

<ul><li>on any search results page, select display format 'map imagine slideshow' at the bottom of the page</li></ul>


<h3>Hand Picking Images</h3>

<p>You can hand craft images using the 'Marked Images' feature. When browseing search results, if you select the "plus links" display format, then you can mark individual images, also find the button top right on any full size photo page.</p>

<p>Note: images are replayed in the order marked</p>

<p>Once you have some images in your list, return to the <a href="/search.php">main search page</a>, and in the 'Marked Images' section, select 'View as Search Results' - you now have a set of results just showing your images, which you can turn into a map imagine slideshow as above</p>

<div class="interestBox">let us know how you get on!</div>
