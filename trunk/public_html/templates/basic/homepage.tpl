<h3>What is Geographing?</h3>
<ul>
<li>It's a game - how many grid squares will you contribute?</li>
<li>It's a geography project for the people</li>
<li>It's a national photography project</li>
<li>It's a great reason to go out and enjoy the cities, towns, 
villages and countryside that is the British Isles and it's a 
truly open source, open community web development project that 
you can be part of</li>
</ul>
</div></div>

<p>We have a growing collection of geographically representative photographs 
for every square kilometre of the 
<acronym title="Great Britain, Ireland and smaller adjacent islands">British Isles</acronym>
but we need your help!<p>

<p>You can</p>
<ul>

    <li><a title="Submit a photograph" href="/submit.php">upload pictures and information</a></li>
    <li><a title="Browse photographs" href="/browse.php">browse images taken by other members</a></li>

<h3>How can I activate a grid square?</h3>

<p>If you're the first to submit a proper &quot;geograph&quot; for the grid square
you'll get a geograph point added to your profile and the warm glow that comes
with it. So what makes an image a genuine geograph?</p>
<ul>
<li>The image must be taken within the grid square </li>
<li>You must clearly show at close range one of the main geographical features within the square</li>
<li>You should include a short description relating the image to the map square</li>
</ul>

<h3>How do I get started?</h3>
