<p>Excuse our dust, we're working fast to build a site that can
cope with the interest we're getting in this project.</p>

<p>What project you say? Well this site aims to collect a geographically
representative photograph for every square kilometre of the 
<acronym title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</acronym> and 
<acronym title="Republic of Ireland">Ireland</acronym></p>
 
<p>While we implement all the cool ideas we've got, we encourage you to 
<a title="register now" href="/register.php">register</a> and go out and take some pictures! For some,
it's a game - how many grid squares will <i>you</i> contribute?</p>

<p>If you have any questions, check the <a title="Frequently Asked Questions" href="/faq.php">FAQ</a>, and 
<a title="contact us" href="contact.php">contact us</a> with any queries</p>

<p>Come back soon!</p>
