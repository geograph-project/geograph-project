<p>The Geograph <acronym title="Great Britain, Ireland and smaller adjacent islands">British Isles</acronym> 
project aims to collect a geographically 
representative photograph for every square kilometre of the 
<acronym title="Great Britain, Ireland and smaller adjacent islands">British Isles</acronym> 
and you can be part of it.</p>

<p>This a true community project, possible only thanks to the amazing 
skills and generosity of people like you with an interest in geography, 
photography, web development, the outdoors, geocaching or may be even 
all of them!</p>

<p>We've already made it possible for you to upload pictures and information 
and browse those taken by other members and we've got some cool ideas for 
new features to be added soon.</p>

<p><a title="register now" href="/register.php">Registration</a> is free so 
why not join us, then go out and take some 
pictures in a grid square near you - all you need is a camera and a map. 
Have a look at some of the recent submisions to get an idea of what 
it's all about.</p>
