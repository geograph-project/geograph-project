# The IGNORE is because tehre are multiple categories, with same label (ie without spaces), eg "Well house" and "Wellhouse"
... doesnt really matter which we expand to.
... although annoyingly a few have different expandsions. Pipe bridge=>subject:bridge and Pipebridge=>subject:pipe
... we loose that and effectivly pick one at random!
