Geograph GridFS Implementation

	A new lightweight virtual distributed filesystem (DFS) to address 
	many of the problems faced with the current Network File System (NFS)
	used on the Live Geograph WebServers. 

	Basically, takes a number of storage servers, and presents a single 
	unified and clean file system. At the same time making sure files are 
	sent to remote backup locations for safe keeping. 


Initial setup

	svn checkout http://svn.geograph.org.uk/svn/apps/trunk/geogridfs/ /folder/of/your/choice

	Copy config.example.py to config.py

	Edit config.py to point to a real database, correct mount list, and identity - see file for details

	import database.sql into the database


Provisioning a Storage Node 

	Make sure metadata knows about this node, (add this server to the replicas SET column in the file table)

	Run this ONCE, when a new storage node is added:

		python replicator.py -a walk
		
		will walk the local folder, tell the metedata about any unknown files, and add self to replicas of existing files

	Setup command to run via cron, eg once a minute. Runs a lightweight SQL query to find new files that should be copied to this node
		
		sudo -u www-data crontab -e

		* * * * * * /bin/python replicator.py -a replicate
