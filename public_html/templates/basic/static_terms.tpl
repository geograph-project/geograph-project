 <h2>Terms of Use and Privacy Policy (the quick version)</h2>

 <p>Lawyers, eh? Geograph Project's terms of use for the {$http_host} website can
 be boiled down to the following:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>We'll do no evil</b>. We won't sell your personal details to
 spammers or abuse the copyright on your submissions.</li>
 <li><b>We want you to do no evil to us</b>. Don't spider or
 leech the site and be respectful to other users of the site. Make sure you own the
 copyright on the images you submit and check the accuracy of the information you supply and/or choose to use.</li>
 <li>If there is a problem, <b>you agree to contact us so that we can work it out together</b>. We're just trying to build something worthwhile.
 <a href="/contact.php">Contact us</a> with your concerns.</li>

 </ul>

<p>Below is a somewhat lengthier expression of the above. Make a nice cup of
tea, put your feet up, and prepare to be riveted by a rollercoaster ride of legal
boilerplate...</p>
