<h3>What is Geographing?</h3>

	<ul>
	<li>It's a game - how many grid squares will you contribute?</li>
	<li>It's a geography project for the people</li>
	<li>It's a national photography project</li>
	<li>It's a good excuse to get out more!</li>
	<li>It's a free and <a href="#opensource">open online community</a> project for all</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>See the original <a title="guide to geographing" href="/help/guide">guide to good geographing</a>, <a title="Geograph Quickstart Guide" href="/article/Geograph-Quickstart-Guide"><b>contributors quickstart guide</b></a>, and the <a href="/article/Geograph-Introductory-letter">welcome letter</a>.</p>

<div id="goodgeograph">
<a name="goodgeograph"></a>
<h3>What makes a good Geograph image?</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>You must clearly show at close range one of the main geographical features within the square<br/><br/></li>
	<li>You should include a short description relating the image to the map square<br/><br/></li>
	<li>Photographing a subject that could be useful to the child in interpreting a map<br/><br/></li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div class="top"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div>

<div id="points">
<a name="points"></a>
<h3>How do I get a geograph point for my image?</h3>
	<p>If you're the first to submit a proper &quot;geograph&quot; for the grid square
	you'll get a geograph point added to your profile and the warm glow that comes
	with it; because many of the easy ones have already been grabbed, getting a geograph point today is a real achievement.</p>
	
	<p>We welcome many Geograph images per square, so even if you don't get the point, you are still making a valuable contribution to the project. You can earn yourself a personal point by submitting a &quot;geograph&quot; for a square that is new to you.</p>
</div>
<div class="top"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div>

<div id="supplemental">	
<a name="supplemental"></a>
<h3>What is a supplemental image?</h3>
	<p>If an image doesn't quite fulfill the geograph criteria above, but is still a good
	image, we'll accept it as &quot;supplemental image&quot; - no geograph points are awarded,
	but the image will still appear on the selected grid square. A square that just contains
	supplemental images is still open to be claimed as a geograph though!</p>

	<p><img src="/templates/basic/img/icon_alert.gif" alt="Note" width="25" height="22" align="absmiddle"/> Follow this link for a <a title="geograph and supplemental guide" href="/article/Geograph-or-supplemental">more in depth discussion</a> on the finer points of moderation.</p>
</div>
<div class="top"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div>

<div id="multiple">
<a name="multiple"></a>
<h3>Do you accept multiple images per square?</h3>
	<p>Certainly - the points system is there to encourage people to make that extra effort 
	to capture squares we don't have photos for yet - but we welcome additional 
	geograph or supplemental images, perhaps showing a different subject, or a different time of year. 
	You could be gaining yourself a personal point too.</p>
	
	<p>Everyone sees things differently - feel free to give us your take on any square. Some squares have 
	been done in considerable <a href="/statistics/most_geographed.php" title="squares with good overage">detail</a> - helping to more fully document and add <a href="/moversboard.php?type=depth" title="Depth Weekly Leaderboard">depth</a> to a square. In particular watch out for things others may have missed - the coverage maps can help with this.</p>
</div>
<div class="top"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div>

<div id="findsquares">
<a name="findsquares"></a>
<h3>How do I find what squares need photographing?</h3>
	<p>If you are looking for squares to obtain a point, try the <a href="/mapbrowse.php">coverage maps</a>, and look for green squares; also accessible from that page are various printable checksheets for easy reference in print form. More technical users might enjoy <a href="/gpx.php">GPX</a>, or <a href="/memorymap.php">Memory Map</a> downloads. </p>

	<p>Many of the squares have been captured but with only have a few photos; checkout the <a href="/mapbrowse.php?depth=1">depth map</a>, from this you can find under-represented squares. In the same vein we have a number of maps to show the distribution of photos within a square, usually on a centisquare grid, which divides a gridsquare into 100 squares, each 100m by 100m.</p>

	<p>We have also recently introduced a new map, &quot;<a href="/mapbrowse.php?recent=1">Recent Only</a>&quot; this shows squares recent photos. Help us keep the coverage current by photographing squares without any recent photos (orange or green).</p>

	<p>Also look out for <img src="http://{$static_host}/img/geotag_16.png" width="16" height="16" align="absmiddle" alt="geotagged icon"/> icons around the site, click them to take you to the links page for the location. From that page you can access textual lists of squares in need of photos. (as well as direct links to <a href="/article/Mapping-on-Geograph">many of the maps the site has</a>)</p>

<div class="top"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div>

<div id="resize">
<a name="resize"></a>
<h3>Do I need to resize my photos? Are there size limits?</h3>
	<p>You can upload images of any size, portrait or landscape, but we do resize them so their
	longest dimension is 640 pixels. We do not keep your original print quality image,
	only our resized screen-quality version.</p>

	<p>Ideally images shouldn't have the longest dimension less than 480 pixels, while we might accept such images if they hold particular interest, we would really prefer a larger image.</p>

	<p>We do preserve the EXIF headers from your original image, so it is
	advantageous to upload your original camera image if you want this information
	to be kept.</p>

<h3>I disagree with the location or title of an image - what can I do?</h3>
	<p>Our <a href="/help/changes">"Change Suggestions"</a> allow any registered user 
	to suggest a change of grid reference or title/comment
	information - simply view the full size image and click the "report a problem" link.

<div id="legal">

<h3>What are my legal rights when taking photographs?</h3>
	<p>Let's preface this by stating <b>We Are Not Lawyers</b>, and if you have any doubts
	about your right to take picture, then you're probably better off not submitting it to us.
	However, there is a 
	{external href="http://www.sirimo.co.uk/ukpr.php" text="useful guide"}
	available which outlines your rights in the UK fairly concisely.

<div id="counties">
<a name="counties"></a>
<h3>Counties, I'm confused, which do you display?</h3>
	<p>We use county information to aid recognition of place names on photo pages and other areas of the site, like helping to disambiguate search terms (e.g. a search for "Gillingham")</p>
	
	<p>For Ireland, it's simple; we just use the traditional counties. Great Britain isn't so easy, which has seen three <i>major</i> county structures;</p>

	<dl class="picinfo">
		<dt>Ceremonial Counties (sometimes known as Geographic)</dt>
		<dd>These were introduced in 1974 primarily as a way to define areas for County Councils. Although these are possibly what most people recognize as counties, a suitable dataset to allow us to use these counties would be too costly for us to bear. So we must compromise a little...</dd>

		<dt>Administrative Counties (also known as District/Unitary Authorities)</dt>
		<dd>These are the modern 'counties' in use by the current government (since 1997). This is the best dataset we have available, so we display it prominently in the gazetteer line on photo pages. It is also useful for identifying the council responsible for the area. However for large towns/cities, for example Sheffield, which are in their own Authority (therefore the 'county' of Sheffield), we attempt to be clever and display the Historic County instead.</dd>

		<dt>Historic Counties</dt>
		<dd>These are the counties that have evolved over many hundreds of years and were in active use until 1974. We use this data as a fallback - where we've opted to display the administrative country on a photo page, you can often find the historic county by hovering over this title.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>For a more in depth explanation, see {external href="http://www.abcounties.co.uk/" text="abcounties.org.uk"}. <span class="nowrap">(however beware that the site doesn't use the exact same terms)</span></p>

<h3>What do all these strange words mean?</h3>
	<p>Well, if it's a 'geographism' - a term developed during use on this site, then see <a href="/article/Geographisms">this glossary article</a> we have started compiling. There is also a wide range of sites dealing with Acronyms, and Abbreviations, listed on {external href="http://www.dmoz.org/Reference/Dictionaries/By_Subject/Computers/Internet_Terms_and_Acronyms/" text="DMOZ here"}.</p>

	<p>Putting this together requires many people to donate their
	time or resources, and we wanted to be sure that we created a resource
	free from commercial exploitation in future. To that end, the site software
	is available for re-use under the terms of the GNU Public Licence (GPL).</p>

	<p>In addition, we require all submitters to adopt a 
	{external href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/" text="Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike"} 
	licence on their photographic submissions. While our volunteer photographers
	keep copyright on their photos, they also grant the use of their photographs
	in return for attribution (take a look at a <a title="View a typical photograph" href="/photo/14">typical 
	submission</a> for more details).</p>

	<p>In a nutshell, we wanted to build a true community project that won't 
	leave a nasty taste in the mouth by getting sold for shedloads of cash and
	taken away from the people who contributed. These licence terms ensure that the
	site and content can never be "taken away" from you. See <a href="/help/freedom">Freedom - The Geograph Manifesto</a>

<div id="commercial">
<a name="commercial"></a>
<h3>Why must I agree to allow commercial use of my image?</h3>
	<p>Running this site costs money, particularly over time as the storage
	requirements are quite large. We require commercial rights to enable us to
	support the running costs. One way we may do this is through sales of 
	montage posters once we reach a critical mass of submissions.</p>

	<p>Granting everyone the same rights actually protects the site community
	from exploitation (see previous FAQ entry), but do bear in mind that we only
	retain a screen-quality version of your image, and that under the terms of 
	the Creative Commons licence, you must be credited for any use of your image</p>

<h3>I use AOL, and the images look terrible!</h3>
	<p>AOL's default settings for graphics is to show &quot;Compressed Graphics Only&quot;. 
	This means AOL is selectively <i>re-compressing</i> images before you see them on your
	screen. This loses a lot of image quality.</p>

	<p>You should reset the preferences under &quot;My AOL/Preferences/WWW&quot; to display 
	&quot;Uncompressed Graphics&quot;. You will pay only a small penalty in download time to see 
	this and other photo oriented sites the way everyone else can see them.</p>

<div id="missing">

<h3>Many thumbnails seem to be missing, any idea of the cause?</h3>
	<p>Some firewall programs, in particular Norton Internet Security, block images that are the same size as some common advertisements. Unfortunately many thumbnails and some map images happen to be this exact size.</p>

	<p>So if you use such a program you might like to try turning it off temporarily and trying again, and if that gets our images back, then have a look for the option to disable this, arguably, flawed method of security.</p>
