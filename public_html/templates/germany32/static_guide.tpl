<h2>Geographing Guide</h2>

<p>A good Geograph presents images and information on the main human and 
physical geographical feature(s) present in any given ordnance survey 1km 
grid square.
</p>

<p>Photos need not be master works of art, the important thing is the human 
and physical geographical information they contain.</p>

<p>You can plan your Geograph using a hardcopy map or by visiting the 
{external title="Get-a-map&trade;" href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/getamap/" text="Get-a-map&trade;"} website or for really high tech geographing, you could use a 
Pocket PC or GPS equipped with mapping software (for example Memory Map).</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<div style="float:right;width:400px;position:relative">
<img src="/templates/basic/img/guide_map.png" width="400" height="400" alt="Map of SD5300"/> 
<div class="copyright">Image produced from the Ordnance Survey Get-a-map service. Image reproduced with 
kind permission of Ordnance Survey and Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland.</div>
</div>

<p>
I entered my home village of Billinge in the search box on the 
{getamap gridref='SD5300' text='Get-a-map'} page
and the result was this map (The purple spot indicates the centre of the 
SD5300 grid square).</p>




 

<p>The Getamap site also allows searching by grid reference and using this method 
you can select a grid reference from our website that hasn't yet been Geographed 
and look at its main features.</p>

 

<p>Our selected map square is primarily a residential area with a staggered cross 
road at the junction of the A571 and B5207. There is a church at the crossroads at 
533007 and a school close to the centre of the square in the heart of the residential 
area. From local knowledge, open farmland dominates the Eastern third of the grid 
square.</p>
