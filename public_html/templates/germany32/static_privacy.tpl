<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<div style="max-width:100ex">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This privacy statement informs you about what data is processed by our web project in which way and for what purpose.
For your convenience, we offer you this condensed version describing which data we process for what purpose.
For legal details, please refer to <a href="#dsg">the detailed version below</a>.</p>

<h3>Unregistered visitors</h3>

<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>In order to improve usability and security, web sites make use of so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_management#Client-side_web_sessions">session cookies</a>.
These tiny text files are temporarily stored on the visitor's device and usually deleted after use by the browser.
On the one hand, they are used to prevent the browser from "forgetting" user interaction of the current session (e.g. navigation on the <a href="/mapbrowse.php">Geograph map</a>).
On the other hand, they are used to prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery">CSRF attacks</a> targeted at our users.</p>
<p>On our users' request, we additionally introduced permanent cookies in order to store settings without requiring the user to register and log in.
Currently, we store the settings of the various maps we display on our site.</p>
<p>You can disable our use of cookies in your browser settings. Existing cookies can be deleted manually in the browser settings.</p>

<h4>Logging</h4>
<p>Every day, our web server logs requests (time, browser, referring and visited page) into a log file. Old log files are deleted automatically after 15 days.
This is done for
</p>
<ul>
<li>finding and fixing configuration and software errors,</li>
<li>evaluating statistics in order to detect unusual request patterns indicating attacks and other abusive requests, and</li>
<li>investigating and responding to attacks and other abusive requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have been experiencing repeatedly excessive server load caused by poorly configured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler">web crawlers</a>
or (less frequent) by automated malicious requests or even automated search for exploitable security vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
we have to deal with automated attempts to register fake accounts or to post SPAM messages on the forums. These circumstances require us to
temporarily store these log files. Under such circumstances, we also may include IP addresses into those log files.</p>

<h4>Contact forms</h4>
<p>As an easy means to get support or to get in contact with us for other reasons, we offer a <a href="https://{$http_host}/contact.php">contact form</a>.
After submitting your message along with your email address, our server generates an email from your input and sends this mail
to the members of our support team. In order to facilitate user support, this email also contains information about browser type and the referring Geograph page.
None of the submitted data is stored on our server, as it is directly transmitted to the recipients.</p>
<p>We additionally offer individual contact forms assigned to the profile and photo pages of every registered user,
allowing visitors and users to contact those directly.
Also in this case, no data is stored on our server, as we build an email from the specified email address and message text as well as the IP address and
send it directly to the email address connected to the recipient's user profile.</p>

<h4>External content (maps, profile picture)</h4>
<p>
As a geography project, we are very interested in offering a large number of maps  accompanying the
subjects documented by our contributors. Therefore, pages containing map frames contain elements hosted on
third party servers.</p>
<p>Additionally, we enable our registered users to integrate a profile picture on their profile pages.
These profile pictures are hosted by the third party service "Gravatar".</p>
<p>Some of our maps are equipped with an input field allowing users to
search for a place name. As we are not capable of providing a full-fledged geographical search function,
we transmit the query to Google Maps using the Google Maps API Geocoder in order to mark
the requested place on the map.</p>
<p>While we do not transmit personal user data to any third party, we have no influence
on what data third party services do collect and process themselves. Note that your browser needs to transmit
your IP address in order to enable communication and that those services may also use cookies. Please refer to the
privacy statements of said services.</p>

<h3>User generated content</h3>
<p>Our registered contributors publish images and texts under their user accounts.
Contributors are required to follow the legal requirements, such as observing privacy rules
and asking a depicted person for permission before publication, if necessary.</p><p>
If you still have concerns regarding a user's contribution,
please contact the contributor directly via the message tool accessible on the respective profile or photo pages
or send a message to our support team using the <a href="https://{$http_host}/contact.php">contact form</a>.
</p>

<h3>Registered contributors</h3>
<p>Users can register in order to publish content on our project pages.
User generated content includes photographs equipped with geographical meta data, which are published
in order to document the geography of Germany, as well as articles, tour reports, galleries and forum posts.</p>

<h4>Email address</h4>
<p>When registering, users are required to specify an email address. It is used to communicate
within the project and to allow visitors of our web site to contact our contributors for requests regarding
their published content.
We do <b>not</b> publish this email address unless the user explicitly wants to display it on his profile page.
Registered users will receive emails about corrections and enquiries regarding their published content as well as
updates about forum discussions they subscribed to.</p>
<p>Upon request, users can use profile pictures linked to their email addresses using the service Gravatar.
In order to obtain a profile picture, we send the respective email address in an encrypted ("hashed") form
to this service. This procedure allows this service to determine the profile picture assigned to the email
address without transferring the email address itself.
</p>
<p>If you do not agree that we store and use your email address as described above, you should refrain from
registering to our project.
If you have already registered an account, you may contact us using the <a href="https://{$http_host}/contact.php">contact form</a>
and ask us to disable your account and delete the corresponding data.</p>

<h4>Name</h4>
<p>When registering, users are required to specify a name they wish to be recognised by inside the project as well as in public.
This is needed in particular for contributed photos because they are published under a
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">creative commons licence</a> which allows
distribution and reuse of the work crediting the original author.</p>
<p>It is the user's choice whether to specify the real name. Both abbreviated names and pseudonyms are in use among our contributors.</p>
<p>The user may also specify a nick name which is used in our forums.</p>

<h4>Profile page</h4>
<p>At their own request, our contributors may publish contact data such as
web address, publicly visible email address, profile picture or free text on their profile page.
This data and user-specific site preferences are stored on our server.</p>
<p>This data, including site preferences, can be edited on the profile page.</p>

<h4>User generated content</h4>
<p>The content our users want to publish on our project pages are stored permanently on our servers.
This includes photographs including meta data as well as articles, tour reports, galleries and forum posts.</p>
<p>In principle, these can be edited or deleted in respect to the aims of our project.
Please contact us using the
<a href="https://{$http_host}/contact.php">contact form</a> if you need assistance.
We reserve the right to restrict changes or deletion of data in the case of conflicts with the aims of our project.
This concerns licencing problems (photographs are published under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">creative commons licence</a>)
as well as collectively created content which might get fragmented or devalued.</p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>We allow our contributors to automatically log in. This feature needs another cookie to be stored by the browser.

<h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
<p>With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right</p>
<ul>
<li>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);</li>
<li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);</li>
<li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;</li>
<li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);</li>
<li>to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.</p>
<p><strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller's future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong></p>

<p>Our website uses Google Maps as a Map service if you explicitly enable this service.
This is a service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 (hereinafter: Google).</p>
<p>We also use the Google Maps GeoCoder: You can enter a location name, from which this service determines geographical coordinates, which are used to mark the corresponding place on a map.</p>
<p>Through certification according to the EU-US Privacy Shield</p>
<p><a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active</a></p>
<p>Google guarantees that it will follow the EU's data protection regulations when processing data in the United States.</p>
<p>If you access the Google Maps components integrated into our website, Google will store a cookie on your device via your browser. Your user settings and data are processed to display our location and create a route description. We cannot prevent Google from using servers in the USA.</p>
<p>The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in optimizing the functionality of our website.</p>
<p>By connecting to Google in this way, Google can determine from which website your request has been sent and to which IP address the directions are transmitted.</p>
<p>If you do not agree to this processing, you have the option of preventing the installation of cookies by making the appropriate settings in your browser. Further details can be found in the section about cookies above.</p>
<p>In addition, the use of Google Maps and the information obtained via Google Maps is governed by the <a href="http://www.google.de/accounts/TOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Terms of Use</a> <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms?gl=DE&amp;hl=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/terms?gl=DE&amp;hl=en</a> and the <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/de_de/help/terms_maps.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terms and Conditions for Google Maps</a> https://www.google.com/intl/de_de/help/terms_maps.html.</p>
